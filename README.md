# Brainfuck Visualizer

Javascript [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) Interpreter + Visualizer


Couple of years ago, I was looking for a brainfuck visualiser for an experiment I was running 
and this was the best I came across. Unfortunately, by the time I looked for it again, the 
repository was gone. I managed to find this from a third user who had cloned it and based my 
derivation on it.

The original version listed the following as contributors:

- Fatih Erikli ([fatiherikli](http://github.com/fatiherikli))
- Henry Heikkinen ([rce](https://github.com/rce))
- Gabriele Cirulli ([gabrielecirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli))
- Asger Hautop Drewsen ([tyilo](https://github.com/Tyilo))
- Dwillie ([dwille](https://github.com/dwillie))
- Eugene Sharygin ([eush77](https://github.com/eush77))
